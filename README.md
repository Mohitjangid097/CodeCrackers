# CodeCrackers
I have developed a website called “CodeCrackers”, which is predominantly based on the online coding tutorial platform that helps Novice programmers learn coding by practically implementing it in the website compiler. The main goal of this project is to develop a tutorial platform where users won't feel intimidated by coding. On this website, users can code along while learning. For this purpose, the website would essentially have a code editor and compiler. This website can be accessed as an open-source e-learning platform. Users who wish to sign up by providing their name and mail will have access to the quizzes and progress section. The intelligent hinting system is built with a button to request hints from the system and a fixed progression of programming tasks.

<h4>* Tech Stack used:</h4>
<ul>
<li>HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,Bootstrapt for Front end.</li>
<li>PHP for Backend</li>
<li>Database used - MySQL</li>
</ul>

# Why CodeCrackers 
The main problem this project will endeavour is to eliminate the stress and anxiety in the novice mindset about programming and to implement a great leave of confidence in coding. A subproblem would be toachieve in executing a successful, intelligent hinting system. The supplementary problem is to create code examples, teaching materials, and information provided in this tutorial platform must berudimentary, beginner friendly, and easily comprehended by the novice so that they never find programming a daunting, challenging, or perplexing process.
